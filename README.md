I am Nafisa, building Novellisteer - A platform and community for introverted ambitious women during the weekend. Helping brands build reliable and healthy communities as a freelance with a team via my business Damiel Badra while exploring my interest in cyber security. I love talking about pop culture, strategy, technology & processes.


🔭 Creator of <a href="https://novellisteer.com"> Novellisteer</a>, here I am working towards helping introveted. ambitious women live their best lives through our membership, newsletter, podcast, blog, courses, product, and events as our vision is to create a movement of women who aren’t afraid to follow their hearts; who aren’t afraid to dream it, visualize it and do it.

✨ Building The Seeker Effect - Where I build security initiatives like the Not So Linear newsletter and help businesses defend against insider threats with make it make-it-make-sense content, training, demos and talks.
